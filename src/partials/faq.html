          <h3 class="faq-list-title">Can I play offline?</h3>
          <p class="faq-list-text">
            Yes! Space Matchers is fully optimized for offline gameplay. Whether
            you're in airplane mode or lost in a Wi-Fi dead zone, all 200+
            levels are accessible. Your progress is saved locally and syncs with
            your account when you reconnect to the internet. It's a perfect game
            for flights, commuting, or relaxing on the couch with no
            distractions.

            What makes Space Matchers different from other match-3 games?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-list-text">
            Space Matchers combines traditional tile-matching mechanics with
            spatial physics and a character-based synergy system. Instead of
            repetitive level grids, you get orbital paths, rotating boards, and
            evolving environmental hazards. On top of that, the game features no
            ads, no timers, and no forced purchases. All characters are unlocked
            through in-game progress—not payments.

          <h3 class="faq-list-title">What happens if I fail a level?</h3>
          <p class="faq-list-text">
            Failure doesn't block your journey—it changes it. When a level is
            failed, the galaxy enters a state of minor distortion: tiles might
            fall in reversed gravity, warp speed increases, or you might lose
            access to certain boosters temporarily. But don't worry — these
            shifts reset when you replay or complete levels elsewhere. It
            encourages adaptation and adds variety.

            How do the space animals help in gameplay?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-list-text">
            Each crewmate you unlock brings a special passive power. For
            example, Catryna boosts diagonals, while Lamirez randomly clones
            power tiles. You can customize your active crew before each level,
            creating synergy between character powers and booster loadouts. This
            transforms traditional match-3 into a more tactical experience where
            your team composition directly impacts the outcome.

            Is the game really free? Where's the catch?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-list-text">
            The game is 100% free to play and free of disruptive ads.
            Monetization is cosmetic only — for example, buying a new visual
            skin for your tiles, or unlocking animated finishers for boosters.
            There are no paywalls, no energy limits, and no levels that require
            spending to pass. You earn rewards through skill and consistency,
            not your wallet.

            Will there be more content in the future?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-list-text">
            Absolutely. The game is designed to expand. New galaxies, crewmates,
            tile types, and space events are introduced monthly. Players who
            finish the current campaign can access event galaxies, seasonal
            quests, and "Void Challenges" — ultra-hard puzzle chains with
            exclusive visuals and titles.
